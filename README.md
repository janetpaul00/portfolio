The challenge was to create a portfolio website, so I created one for a Duck; it was more fun than I thought it would be. Copy written by ChatGPT.

I got to refresh a lot of my React knowledge via this project. I learnt about pagination and how to use React in a regular coding environment (as opposed to the platform I was learning it from).
